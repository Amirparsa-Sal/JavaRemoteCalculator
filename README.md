# Java Remote Calculator
A client-server multi threaded calculator based on JavaFX.

## Running on windows using command line

There is two batch script files in the project which you can use them to run the program.

before that you should change the `client.bat` file and edit the "javafx" variable defined in it and replace its values with your own path to the JavaFX lib folder.

After that, you can run the server using `server.bat` file and the client using `client.bat` file.

### Important Note

With running the program from the command prompt, the "enter" key does not work and you should use "=" key (at the top of the keyboard) to trigger "=" button.

If you run the program in the IntelliJ Idea the "enter" key works also.
